All data sourced from publicly available WCIRB reports:
- Incurred loss triangles (aggregate and by injury type)
- Payroll exposure triangles by NAICS sector
- Experience triangles by premium range

### Project Phases

**Phase 1 — Core Analysis (In Progress)**
- Aggregate Mack Chain Ladder with full stochastic framework
- Exposure development analysis (NAICS payroll triangles)
- Exposure-Based BF using developed ultimate exposures
- Method comparison: mature vs. immature policy years
- Diagnostics: residual analysis, calendar year effects

**Phase 2 — Segmented Analysis (Planned)**
- Development patterns by injury type (Medical Only, Indemnity, Permanent Disability, etc.)
- NAICS sector exposure mix analysis over time
- Premium range segmentation with credibility weighting
- Cross-segment reconciliation

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel (manual implementation — all formulas visible and auditable)

### Key Questions This Project Addresses

1. When should a reserving actuary rely on observed development vs. prior expectations?
2. How does exposure development (payroll audit adjustments) affect BF reserve estimates?
3. How do California WC development patterns vary by injury type and account size?
4. What is the range of reasonable reserve outcomes given parameter uncertainty?
